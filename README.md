> Software will need settings.json to start working; provide paths, window title in the settings.json file.

Background software is the one from whom you want to shift control to the other software. Foreground software will be the one which needs to be active to get data from background software.


This software opens background software first, clicks on few buttons, enters some text into fields and then minimizes the background window and opens the foreground window.
